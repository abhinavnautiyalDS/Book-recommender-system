# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This Book Recommendation System suggests books based on user input. It uses a **popularity-based recommendation approach**, meaning it recommends books that are widely liked and rated highly by users. The system also allows users to refine recommendations by selecting any recommended book to get further suggestions.

## Approach
We built this system using a **popularity-based filtering method**, where books are recommended based on:
1. **Number of Ratings:** Books with more ratings are prioritized.
2. **Average Rating:** Higher-rated books are given preference.
3. **User Engagement:** Books frequently interacted with by users are considered.
4. **Similarity Metrics:** A similarity matrix (based on book features and user preferences) is used to enhance recommendations.

The system leverages the **Book-Crossing dataset**, which includes book details, user reviews, and ratings to generate the most relevant suggestions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Book-Crossing dataset**, sourced from **Kaggle**. It consists of three main tables:
1. **Books Dataset:** Contains information about books.
   - `ISBN`: Unique identifier for books.
   - `Book-Title`: Title of the book.
   - `Book-Author`: Author of the book.
   - `Year-Of-Publication`: Year the book was published.
   - `Publisher`: Name of the publisher.
   - `Image-URL-S`, `Image-URL-M`, `Image-URL-L`: URLs of book cover images (small, medium, and large).

2. **Users Dataset:** Contains user information.
   - `User-ID`: Unique user identifier.
   - `Location`: User's location.
   - `Age`: Age of the user (if available).

3. **Ratings Dataset:** Contains book ratings given by users.
   - `User-ID`: ID of the user who rated the book.
   - `ISBN`: The book that was rated.
   - `Book-Rating`: Rating given by the user (0-10 scale).

After preprocessing, the dataset contains **900 users** and **690 books**.

## Features
- ðŸ“– **Search Books:** Find books by entering partial or full titles.
- ðŸ”¥ **Top 5 Recommendations:** Get five similar books based on the selected book.
- ðŸ”„ **Interactive Recommendations:** Click on a recommended book to get further suggestions.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful UI:** A visually appealing interface with a background image and side-by-side book recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (for backend processing)
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Pickle** (to store precomputed similarity matrix)
